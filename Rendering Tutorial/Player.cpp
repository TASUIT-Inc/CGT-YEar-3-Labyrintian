I declare that the following code was produced by Brodie Frail and Daryyl Cully as a group assignment for the Real Time graphics module and that this is our own work.

I am aware of the penalties incurred by submitting in full or in part work that is not our own and that was developed by third parties that are not appropriately acknowledged.
