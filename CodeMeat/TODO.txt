TODO:
Ranked Most Important -> Least Important
DO NOT remove objectives instead mark each one with a result and conclusion
Example:
	Implement Batch renderer - Result: Failure. Conclusion: Overall too complicated, time taken to understand the concept and implement deemed too long
	
Objectives:

	Rendering:

		Implement Defered Shading - Result Completed. Conclusion: Due to Errors with the lighting shader and models texture path directories this caused some strife but has now been fixed and implemented
		Implement FrameBuffer Manager - 
		

	Physics:

		Implement Collisions based off of VertexData in LoaderParams
		Implement Event Manager class
		Implement Trigger Events

	Engine:

		Implement Instance Managing - Result: Semi-Completed. Conclusion: Objects can now be instanced through the use of the AddInstance method in the gameobject.h file
		Implement External Instance Saving
		Implement Random Map Generation

	Audio:
		Implement Instanced Audio class
		Implement Audio Manager class

	Other:
		Refactor Code From Master Branch to new refactor Branch - Result: Completed. Conclusion: Code from the master branch is now cleaner and more effitient.
		Implement Level Saving and Loading
		Implement TextureManager class in the Textures Sub-Folder
		Have Model.h aquire the functionality of LoaderParams so that both LoaderParams and Model are definable under the one type
